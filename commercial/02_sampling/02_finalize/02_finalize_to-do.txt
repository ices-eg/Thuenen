To-Do for the commercial_sampling_02_finalize

--> Requirements: 
 clean and chekcked sampling tables. clean and checked BLE tables
	

--> working steps:
	- check total weight and subsample weight. Add and raise weights were necessary
	- check lan/dis proportions



--> finished process: 
	- every fish has a catch_category
	- catch weight and sample weight are checked for consistency, 
	- length-weight correlation calculated
	- sample weights corrected and checked versus the length-weight correlation

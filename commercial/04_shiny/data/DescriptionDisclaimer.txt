<font size="2">Tables, plots and graphs presented in this document and overviews are made for the internal analysis of  
national fisheries data collection and are not designed for any other use. Data used for the outputs are extracted from the Thünen-OF database 
and European Fleet Register. Due to different aggregations and reporting authorities, data can differ to those, e.g., used for assessments or 
technical reports. The latest year should be viewed as provisional. Data can be 
resubmitted or changed for more than one previous year so there might be differences in other data outputs in time. 
Responsibility for the quality of the data and comparability to other data sources lies with the insitute and federal agencies that provided these data. The respective 
scripts and calculations used for data displaying are publicly available via the Thünen GitHub <a href="https://github.com/ices-eg/thuenen"> Thünen GitHub </a> 
and subject to change as the work of the group progresses.</font>

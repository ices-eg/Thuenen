Fisheries Info ;ALL;All Species ;1;<p>The fisheries resource is the bedrock of the Irish seafood industry.</br> 
Fish Species;COD;Cod ;2;<p> <b>Atlantic cod</b> (<i>Gadus morhua</i>) around Ireland are very fast growing and attain lengths in excess of 35cm in the first year and over 90cm as adults. </p>

Fish Species;HER;Herring ;6;<p> <b>Herring</b> (<i> Clupea harengus</i>) are schooling fish with a diet consisting largely of zooplankton, mainly copeopds. Fish reach a total length of between 28 and 37 cm, depending on the stock. Herring are important prey for cod, seals, whales, dolphins and indeed many predatory fish. Herring reach full maturity by ages 2 or 3. They are not particularly fecund by the standards of other pelagic fish.They can reach 20cm in size in their first to second year, but then growth levels off very quickly and they rarely reach sizes over 30cm.</p> 
Fish Species;PLE;Plaice ;7;<p> <b>Plaice</b> (<i>Pleuronectes platessa</i>) are found throughout the Atlantic coast of Europe and in the western Mediterranean. They are usually found in waters less than 100m depth. Older fish are found in deeper water. Plaice are most commonly found on sandy, muddy or gravel bottom. Small fish are found in intertidal areas and there is evidence to suggest homing behaviour. Males reach maturity between 2 and 6 years, and females between 3 and 7 years, with age at maturity again being dependent on water temperature. Young plaice feed on small worms and shrimp. As they grow their diet becomes more varied and they eat small crustaceans, crabs, mussels, scallops and shrimp.</p> 
Fish Species;POL;Pollack ;8;<p> <b>Pollack</b> is a benthopelagic gadoid, occuring thoughout the north-east Atlantic, mainly over hard bottom. Pollack usually occur at 40-100m depth but are found down to 200m. Young pollack occur mostly inshore while older fish move to deeper waters.</p> 
Fish Species;SPR;Sprat ;9;<p> <b>Sprat</b> (<i>Sprattus sprattus</i>) are a short lived, fast growing species. Sprat feed on plankton and are an important prey fish with several fish species as well as sea birds and marine mammals feeding on this species.</p>
